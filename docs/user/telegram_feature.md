#### Configure department chat IDs

- The "Modify department" page is available from the administration panel.
- Add one or more chat IDs (comma-separated). Features with "Send notification on finish â†’ Telegram" enabled will deliver messages to these IDs.

## Administration and Maintenance

### Delete Telegram authentication links (Django management command)

For testing or maintenance, you can remove Telegram authentication links stored in the backend. This is useful when a user re-links their Telegram account, when cleaning up test data, or when revoking access.

- **Command location**: backend service of the main Cometa project
- **Command name**: `delete_telegram_auth`

Run from the backend project directory where `manage.py` is located.

#### Usage

```bash
python manage.py delete_telegram_auth <chat_id>
python manage.py delete_telegram_auth --all
python manage.py delete_telegram_auth --user-email <email>
```

#### Options

- **chat_id (positional)**: Delete a single Telegram link by its chat ID.
- **--all**: Delete all Telegram authentication links. Use with caution.
- **--user-email <email>**: Delete links for a specific user by email (case-insensitive).
- **--yes**: Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive mode). Applies when deleting by `chat_id`.

#### Behavior and notes

- **Delete by chat ID**: Shows link info and prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` is provided. After deletion, any Django sessions containing `telegram_chat_id` matching the deleted chat ID are also cleared.
- **Delete by user email**: Removes all links tied to the specified user; reports if none found.
- **Delete all**: Displays how many links were found and asks for confirmation before bulk deletion.

#### Examples

- Delete a single link by chat ID (with confirmation):

```bash
python manage.py delete_telegram_auth 123456789
```

- Delete a single link by chat ID (non-interactive):

```bash
python manage.py delete_telegram_auth 123456789 --yes
```

- Delete all links (will prompt):

```bash
python manage.py delete_telegram_auth --all
```

- Delete links for a specific user by email:

```bash
python manage.py delete_telegram_auth --user-email alice@example.com
```
